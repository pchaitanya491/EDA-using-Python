# EDA-using-Python
Performed EDA on a multi-continent population dataset (1970â€“2022) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Cleaned and structured data with advanced pandas, grouped by continent, calculated aggregates, and transposed results for metric comparisons. Visualized trends using line plots, heatmaps, and boxplots to highlight growth patterns.
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)* Performed comprehensive data analysis on a multi-continent population dataset spanning 1970 to 2022. 
Applied advanced pandas techniques to clean and structure the data, including filtering numeric columns, handling non-numeric types, and formatting float outputs for clarity.
Grouped data by continent and calculated statistical aggregates such as mean values, then transposed the results to enable metric-wise comparisons. 
Visualized trends using line plots, heatmaps, and boxplots with customized figure sizes for enhanced readability. 
Leveraged select_dtypes to isolate numeric, object, and float columns for targeted analysis. 
Created a final transposed DataFrame showcasing population growth across continents over time, highlighting regional trends and outliers. 
Demonstrated proficiency in troubleshooting common pandas errors and optimizing data presentation for reporting and dashboard integration.
